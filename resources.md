How to get help
--------------

- **Step 1:** Use [play.golang.org](http://play.golang.org) to create an example of your problem (make sure it runs if it's supposed to.
- **Step 2:** Post on  [GO+](https://plus.google.com/communities/114112804251407510571) or [go-nuts mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts)
- **Step 3:** State your problem clearly, and link to the example on the go playground you creatd in step 1.
- Be respectful.  Most people have a willingness to help, but there are arrogant jerks out there that you can feel free to ignore.

If all else fails, you can use twitter to reach out to us.
