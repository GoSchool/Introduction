#### Instructions for Linux

### Environment - GOPATH

The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. It is likely the only environment variable you'll need to set when developing Go code.

To get started, create a workspace directory and set GOPATH accordingly. Your workspace can be located wherever you like, but we'll use $HOME/go in this document. Note that this must not be the same path as your Go installation.

```bash
mkdir $HOME/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

For convenience, add the workspace's bin subdirectory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```bash

* Tools
  * go fmt
	* go build
	* go test
	* go vet

* Your first program: Hello World!
